#### Description:

PIXTALES is an innovative web application designed to revolutionize the way we interact with images. Utilizing cutting-edge AI and deep learning technologies, PIXTALES provides users with the unique ability to generate descriptive captions for their uploaded images.

## Key Features:

- **Image Captioning**: Upload any image, and PIXTALES will use advanced AI algorithms to analyze and generate a relevant, descriptive caption. This feature is perfect for enhancing understanding of visual content, particularly useful for visually impaired users.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity in mind, our intuitive interface ensures a seamless user experience. Upload images effortlessly and receive instant captions.

- **History Tracking**: Users can view their history of uploaded images along with their generated captions, providing a convenient way to revisit past uploads.

- **Secure and Private**: We prioritize user privacy and data security, ensuring that your images and information are handled with the utmost care.


### How to Run the Application:

1. **Setup Environment**: 
   - You will need to have an environment with python installed(I used version 3.11.5) that must contain the requirements list in the `requirements.txt` file. Some of the requirements are `Flask`, `PyTorch`, `SQL`, `Pillow`, `transformers` and other dependencies.
   - I recommend using a new environment using only the requirements listed so that there are no conflicts between packages.

2. **Running the App**: 
   - Once in the directory where the app.py is (the root of this repository), you can use `flask run` or `python app.py` to run the web app.
   - The previous command will show you in the terminal a URL that you can click on to see the web app.

3. **Using the App**: 
   - Describe how a user can navigate through your app and use its features.

Remember to replace placeholders (like YOUR PROJECT TITLE, URL HERE, TODO) with your actual project information. If you don't have a video demo, you can omit that part or add it later when you have one. 

The README file is important as it gives visitors and potential users an overview of your project, how to set it up, and how to use it. It's also an excellent place to showcase your work and explain your development process.
